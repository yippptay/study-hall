Now that we've learned how to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), let's get a little more practice with it.

For this exercise, you've been provided starter code. `cd` into today's `morning_exercise` directory and open it up in your code editor. Your goal is to use Bootstrap to make it look like the mockup below:

You'll notice you have an `index.html` (open this in the browser) and a `style.css`. Your index is fully filled out, with the exception of the Bootstrap CDN and the necessary Bootstrap classes to "make it work". Your `style.css` has a little bit of styling that will kick in as you code.

### Before you get started:
  - Open up the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/download/)
  - Link the Bootstrap CDN in your index.html
  - Scan your `index.html` for `class=""` every time you see this, you'll need to add a class from the Bootstrap Docs.
  - Not sure if you got them all? Use `command` + `f` to search your document.
