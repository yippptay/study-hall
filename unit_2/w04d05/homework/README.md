# Part 1: TV Shows
In this assignment, you'll get some practice with Express servers!
`cd` into the `tv_shows` directory in your `homework` directory and do your work there.

The full markdown for this assignment can be found here: [TV Shows Markdown](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Nova/tree/master/unit_2/w04d05/homework/tv_shows/README.md)

# Part 2: Flowerbox Mockup
In this assignment, you'll get some more HTML/CSS practice! `cd` into the `flowerbox` directory in your `homework` directory and do your work there. You will notice that all of the image files you need for this assignment are included in that `flowerbox` directory in a folder called `imgs`. Besides that, there is no starter code. It is up to you to touch and link the correct files.

NOTE: If you choose to do the Hungry For More on the Flowerbox assignment (media queries for mobile design), you may find that the Device Mode Emulation in your Chrome Dev tools doesn't work quite as expected. If this is the case, you may need to look into [viewports](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) to fix it. Even if you don't do the Hungry For More, we highly recommend checking this link out and bookmarking it for future reference!
