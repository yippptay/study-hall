# Intro to Internet and Servers + Course Survey

Now that we're going to get into spinning up servers and creating full-stack apps, we want to make sure you have at least a basic understanding of how the internet works, and what the differences between the front-end and back-end are. 

## Setup

In the `homework` directory for today, create a markdown file `internet.md`. Write your answers inside this one markdown file.

## Course Survey

Before you get started with everything below, **please make sure you fill out the mid course survey** that you should have received in your emails from `online@generalassemb.ly`. If you did not get an email, check your spam. If it's not in your spam, DM an instructor to let us know you did not receive one. 

Let us know how you're feeling about the course so far through this survey! It should take maybe 15 minutes or so to fill out and it helps us help you better.
