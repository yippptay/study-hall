# Complete Captain's Log 

![](https://i.imgflip.com/2174sq.jpg)

For tonight's homework, you should already have a leg up from all the lab time you've had throughout the week. Your assignment is to have a full stack full CRUD Captain's Log app -- and, incorporate authorization into it! 

#### Learning Objectives 

- Full stack CRUD app (express/mongo/jsx)
- Authorization 

#### Prerequisites 

- JavaScript
- Node / Express / JSX 
- Mongo/Mongoose 

---

## Getting Started 

Just continue working in the same `captains_log` folder you've been working in this week 

## The Assignment

- An app following all the specifications from the [captain's log markdown](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Nova/blob/master/unit_2/w06d01/student_labs/Captains_Log.md), from the Set up section all the way down to Router section. Doing so should leave you with...

    - A full stack app allowing you to **CRUD ship logs**
    - An app that is structured in **MVC format** (models / views / controllers folders _all_ required! don't forget to refactor your app and move your routes to the controllers folder!) 
    
- Now, finish up that app by **adding authentication and sessions to it**
  
    - Just follow the [instructor notes](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Nova/tree/master/unit_2/w06d03/instructor_notes) to build authentication into your captain's log app the same way you did today 
        - Make sure to watch your variables as you follow along! You were building a `fruits` app in class, but your captains log should have different variables

## Deliverables

- A Captain's Log app that meets all the requirements outlined above. 

## Technical Requirements
	
- Your app MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong

## Submission Guidelines

- Must be submitted no later than the start of the next class by opening an issue as normal. Make sure you link us directly to which folder your completed app is in!
