# Templating with JSX

#### Beginning with the End in Mind

1. Getting comfortable with Express
1. Creating Views with JSX

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript (Functions)

---
# Explanation
# What is JSX ?
 A Syntax that allows us to write our HTML, CSS and Javascript in the same file so that we can more easily create user interfaces
React is one of the most well known users of JSX. But other libraries like Lit-HTML, and KofuJS use it as well.

# express-react-views

This is an [Express](https://expressjs.com) view engine which renders [React](https://reactjs.org/) components on a server. It uses react because it was made by facebook. It renders static markup and *does not* support mounting those views on the client.

This is intended to be used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [ejs](https://ejs.co/)  (Like we have been using), or [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

# JSX USES
You can use JSX as a template language to tell your server how to dynamically change your HTML ( That's what we'll be doing for now)

You can also use JSX for very very sophisticated Dom Manipulation, and that's what we'll be doing in in 2 weeks after we have a good handle on servers.

## A different way of Seperating Concerns ( Component Driven Development )

### Lets Think of Games
1. Job is to fight
1. Job is to fish
1. Job is to heal people

We could sperate 1 big group of fishers, 1 big group of fighters, 1 big group of healers
Each group runs itself and are just dependent upon eachother to survive


OR

We could make a bunch of smaller self sufficient group with a few fishers, a few fighters, a few healers

Not saying either is better but each has it's advantages.

# Imitation
## Usage

```sh
npm init -y && npm i express express-react-views react react-dom
```

**Note:** You must explicitly install `react` as a dependency.

### Add it to your app.

```js
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.set('view engine', 'jsx');
app.engine('jsx', require('express-react-views').createEngine());

// routes here above listen

app.listen(port, (req, res) => {
  console.log("listening...")
})

```


### Views

```
mkdir views
touch views/Index.jsx
```

Under the hood, [Babel][babel] is used to compile your views to be code compatible with your current node version, using the [react][babel-preset-react] and [env][babel-preset-env] presets by default. Only the files in your `views` directory (i.e. `app.set('views', __dirname + '/views')`) will be compiled.

Your views should be node modules that export a React component. Let's assume you have this file in `views/Index.jsx`:

```js
const React = require('react');

class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}

module.exports = HelloMessage;
```

### Routes

Your routes would look identical to the default routes Express gives you out of the box.


```js
// routes here above listen

app.get('/', (req,res) => {
res.render('Index', {name:'John Doe'});
})
```

**That's it!** Layouts follow really naturally from the idea of composition.

### Layouts

Simply pass the relevant props to a layout component.

`views/layouts/Default.jsx`:
```js
const React = require('react');

class DefaultLayout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <html>
        <head><title>{this.props.title}</title></head>
        <body>{this.props.children}</body>
      </html>
    );
  }
}

module.exports = DefaultLayout;
```

`views/Index.jsx`:
```js
const React = require('react');
const DefaultLayout = require('./layouts/default');

class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <DefaultLayout title={this.props.title}>
        <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>
      </DefaultLayout>
    );
  }
}

module.exports = HelloMessage;
```

### Where does my data come from?

All "locals" are exposed to your view in `this.props`. These should work identically to other view engines like we did with EJS, with the exception of how they are exposed. Using `this.props` follows the pattern of passing data into a React component, which is why we do it that way. Remember, as with other engines, rendering is synchronous. If you have database access or other async operations, they should be done in your routes.


## JSX Syntax Quirks
1. className instead of class
1. props (always come from Outside the component)
1. {} to embed Javascript
1. {{}} for inline styles
1. Writing CSS in CamelCase
1. Conditional rendering
1. Everything Must Close
1. Looping with map or map & filter
1. Anything can be dynamic

# Practice

Lets Use Our Spaghetti Stuff from Earlier and lets be creative .... How would we add good old Bootstrap


```html
<div className="container">
  <div className="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
### ...HMMMM WHERE DOES THIS GO.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```
