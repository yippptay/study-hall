# Intro to Spa

##    1. What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)?
* A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use. We are using this type of applications every day. These are, for instance: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook or GitHub.

##    2. What is a Multi-Page Application (MPA)?
* Multi page applications are the traditional web applications that reload the entire page and displays the new one when a user interacts with the web app. Each time when a data is exchanged back and forth, a new page is requested from the server to display in the web browser.

##    3. When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why?
* Our unit 2 apps were MPA. We used routes to access different pages.

##    4. Give two pros of a SPA
* Since single-page applications don’t update the entire page but only required content, they significantly improve a website’s speed.
* SPAs provide users with a simple linear experience. SPA sites contain a clear beginning, middle, and end.

##    5. Give two cons of a SPA
* Some people are of the opinion that SPAs provide poor SEO optimization. This is because single-page apps operate on JavaScript and download data on request from the client side.
* An SPA doesn’t save visitors’ jumps between states. This means that when users click the back button, they won’t go back.

##    6. Give two pros of a MPA
* SEO is better on MPAs since the architecture is native to search engine crawlers. Such apps provide better control over SEO thanks to multiple pages and changing content.
* MPAs allow you to create new content and place it on new pages. Multi-page apps can include as much information about products or services as required, with no page limitations.*

##    7. Give two cons of a MPA
* With multi-page apps, a server needs to reload most resources such as HTML, CSS, and scripts with every interaction.
* Maintaining and updating multiple pages can be a chore, and things only get worse the larger a website becomes. In addition, maintaining security may be problematic because developers need to secure each separate page. Single-page apps allow developers to just secure data endpoints.

##    8. What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL?
* They served as a crack team which understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose.
* They built an insurance application, called App2, which signed up new users in less than half the time of the original app.
* They replaced the website’s crashy login system with a functional (and much less expensive) one of its own design.

##    9. What does 'API' stand for?
* Application Programming Interface

##    10. What is an API?
* An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
