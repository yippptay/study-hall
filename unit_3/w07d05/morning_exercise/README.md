## Getting Started
First things first, let's navigate to [codewars.com](https://codewars.com) \
If you already have an account, go ahead and log in. If not, click "Sign up" and follow along below.

![Codewars Choose Language](https://i.imgur.com/JvoHSKv.png)

After clicking signup, you'll see a screen like this. Choose your language (Javascript). \
If you'd like to add more languages, you can later. But let's start with what we've been learning in class.

Are you worthy? The next step, is a coding challenge! Yes, you must solve this challenge to create an account.

    When we're solving challenges for ourselves, we typically like to console.log the answers so we can see them in the terminal.

    When we want to actually submit data though, we need to return those values. The same goes for Codewars.

Great work! You're now able to create an account. Go ahead and sign up.

Next you want to configure your account.

<div align="left">

- What is your programming experience: We recommend choosing "Learning to Program" or "Junior Developer".
- Choose languages: You can add more later. Stick with just Javascript for now.
- Save at the bottom of the page

## The Dashboard

You will then be taken to the Codewars Dashboard.

### Training w/ Challenges

![Codewars Dashboard Training Section](https://i.imgur.com/1Bx1uhL.png)


At the top we have the training section! This displays your next challenge on the right hand side. Feel free to read it. If you want to complete that challenge, you can click "Train" if you want a different one, you can click "Skip". But wait! There's more:

You can also get different types of challenges by clicking on the drop down currently set to "Rank Up". \
If you feel like the "Rank Up" challenges are too difficult, try switching this to "Fundamentals".

## If the Codewars Platform is Too Foreign
<div align="left">

- For some, switching between text editors can be confusing. If you prefer to use the editor we're using in class (or another you're familiar with) instead of doing your actual coding in the Codewars platform. Go ahead! Code in your editor of choice, test you work and once you think you have the challenge solved, copy and paste your code over to Codewars for submission. Just remember to make sure your code is actually returning your data and not just displaying it in the console.

- Bonus: You can even create a github repo for your coding challenges if you want. Create a repo, clone it to your computer, then create directories inside for each challenge you attempt. This is absolutely not necessary. But it can be nice if you like to quickly reference past code or if you find version control helpful as you solve a challenge.

## Hungry For More?
<div align="left">

-  After you solve a challenge (Codewars calls them 'Kata') you'll have access to other people's solutions. We HIGHLY recommend looking at other people's solutions once they're available to you. This is a really great way to learn more effective or efficient or cleaner ways to solve the challenge. Take note of the methods they use. Research and practice with the methods you'd like to have a better grasp on. You'll find these methods will come in handy in other challenges and projects as well. Once you feel like you know how to do it on your own, you can even refactor your code and try again if you like.

## Fun Stuff

![Codewars Allies Section](https://i.imgur.com/PTSWgvq.png)

Your dashboard also has an Allies section! Notice the 'Clan' part. \
Codewars allows users to "connect" and join a Clan. All users in your clan will show up here along with any other connections you make. This allows for a little healthy competition. The more challenges you complete, the higher you rise in the Clan's ranks. Someone started a General Assemb.ly Clan. Feel free to join it if you want, to join other clans, or to create your own. Want to know how? Read on:

![Codewars Nav Bar](https://i.imgur.com/vhqglVH.png)

The navbar in the upper right hand corner allows you to manage your account.


<div align="left">

- "Training Setup" will bring you back to the page we saw before where you can choose your Programming Experience and Languages.
- "Account Settings" will let you update your account info and your clan.

</div>

![Codewars Account Information](https://i.imgur.com/frzasyF.png)

If you want to join a clan, visit the "Account Settings" page and type in the clan name.


To join the GA clan. Type: `General Assemb.ly `\
When you go back to your dashboard, you'll be able to see everyone else in the clan in that "Allies" section. \
Clans can be a great way to keep you motivated to do more challenges or to do them more often.
