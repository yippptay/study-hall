# MERN Stack

## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe the elements of the MERN stack
1. Set up static files
1. Set up React using Create React App
1. Get Data from our holidays_api app
1. Do rest of CRUD

## Describe the elements of the MERN stack

MERN stack is just a collection of tech that work well together..... Its one of the greatest Stacks ever if you

-   Mongo
-   Express
-   React
-   Node.js

We're going to have two apps:

-   Backend app that services our API
-   Frontend App delivering the UX/UI (In this case using React, but other frontend frameworks include Vue, Angular and Svelte)

It is increasingly common to have a separate back end that just handles data: Desktop and mobile apps are different apps for a user to use, but it makes sense they'd share the backend/data rather than building out that portion twice.

In your student examples folder is a holidays folder with two folders, one for each app.

## The React Application

Their is boiler plate code in the holiday_frontend folder, this boilerplate came from this cloneable template.

https://github.com/AlexMercedCoder/Alex-Merced-React-Parcel-Template

1. `cd holiday_frontend_`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

We will get a CORS ERROR SO WE NEED TO EDIT OUR BACKEND

For safety reasons, requests with different origins are blocked by default.

We'll have to move over to our backend and add an npm package called `cors`

-`npm install cors`

-   in **`server.js`**, with your other dependencies

```js
const cors = require('cors');
```

-   further down, with your other middleware

Note: we only need localhost for this build, but to give you an example of how to limit CORS to a white list for your project (ie your localhost and then your api on heroku)

**server.js** (express backend)

```js
const whitelist = [
    'http://localhost:1985',
    'https://fathomless-sierra-68956.herokuapp.com',
];
const corsOptions = {
    origin: function (origin, callback) {
        if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
            callback(null, true);
        } else {
            callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
        }
    },
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions)); // all routes are now exposed, sometimes you just want to limit access (ie OMDB - it's ok for anyone to see the movies, but you don't want just anyone updating the movies)
```

# Creating the Frontend App

### -> Create your App Component

-   Create State to Holidays
-   Initially pull holidays in useEffect call
-   Render holidays to page (ternary between loading jsx and loaded jsx)

### -> create form and ability to create holidays

-   create form component
-   state for createFormData that is blank and passed into form
-   function to make a post request that is passed into form

### -> add ability to delete holidays

-   create a button for each holiday
-   when clicked invoke function that makes a delete request

### -> add ability to update holidays

-   use same form component
-   state for editFormData that holds the data for the selected holiday
-   function to make put request passed into the form

# Adding Authorization

## Add login route

-   Return to backend and install jwt "npm i jsonwebtoken"
-   require jwt "const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
-   create new login post route
-   if username and password correct, sign jwt and send back as json

```javascript
const token = jwt.sign({ username }, 'token signature');
```

## Create Auth middleware function

```javascript
const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
    //get authorization header from request
    const { authorization } = req.headers;
    //test whether token was sent
    if (authorization) {
        //parse token from header "bearer <token>"
        const token = authorization.split(' ')[1];
        //verify the token, save payload in request, go to next route/middleware
        try {
            const payload = await jwt.verify(token, 'token signature');
            req.user = payload;
            next();
        } catch (error) {
            //if handle verification errors
            res.status(400).json(error);
        }
    } else {
        //if no header, send an error
        res.state(400).json({ error: 'no token in header' });
    }
};
```

-   add the auth middleware to all the routes you want protect

```javascript
app.post('/', auth, (req, res) => {
    //....
});
```

## adjusting the frontend

-   create a piece of state to hold the token initialized as null
-   while null render a login form, render the normal page when has value
-   create handleLogin function for login form
-   when token is returned by login fetch call, add it to state and save it in localstorate (add logic to useEffect to check localstorage for token)
-   add logout button
-   create handleLogout function that makes the token state null and removes the token from localStorage
