# Introduction to Computer Science

In early 2019, General Assembly formed an initiative to improve and standardize our educations strategy for computer science topics.

By looking at market trends and gathering our top instructors we developed a series of lessons and activities available on our platform myGA that would best suit our students' learning paths.

## Our Approach

Our main focus in the Software Engineering Course is to help students build skills and create projects that can be shown to potential employers. This learning strategy has been successful for our graduates.

 When approaching computer science, we wanted to take things on in a fresh and modern way, deeply considering the challenges and pain points of learning these topics in a traditional university setting and leverage our global community to find the best way to support all our students.

We decided on a hybrid learning model that combines videos and slides on myGA along with opportunities to cover some topics  and practice solving problems in class with instructor support.

Students have access to the videos and slides on myGA both during the course and after. This allows students to self-pace with the topics and review any topic at any time.

The content on myGA also provides custom graphics, diagrams and videos to help visualize abstract concepts along with study guides that can be downloaded.  

Finally, numerous code challenges are provided on CodePen that provide tests. These tests allow students to check whether they have successfully completed the code challenge; which allows for feedback outside of class time and post-course.

#### Learning Objectives

- Cover the fundamentals of computer science
- Practice problem solving with computer science concepts
- Prepare for job interviews and jobs in relation to computer science

#### Prerequisites

- Completion of Software Engineering Immersive Unit 1 (JavaScript Fundamentals)

## Getting Started

1. All lessons are on myGA - log in to `my.generalassemb.ly` and find the decks for
- Introduction to Computer Science
- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Design Patterns


## Deliverables

There are technically no deliverables or submissions required for these assignments, but doing these modules are all for your personal benefit.

General Assembly's myGA materials extend past basics allowing for further study and practice beyond the course.

During the course it is expected that the following topics are covered  in this order (lessons are built with the expectation that previous lessons have been completed).

Your instructors will determine when and which activities to cover throughout the course.

As always, we provide a lot of extra activities to accommodate the wide range of experience that our students have. **It is NOT expected that every student finishes every activity/code challenge during the course**, but rather, each student will be able to advance their understanding and skill set by spending time on these activities.

## The Modules 

Below is a comprehensive list of all the modules. **You _do not_ need to do all of these at once**. Alongside your normal homework, we will occasionally include some of these modules for you to go through that night. However you are of course welcome to do more than what we suggest each night, take these supplemental modules at your own pace!
