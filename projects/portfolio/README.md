## WordPress
- It is estsimated that 31% of webpages are built with WordPress. If you think you'd like to work in Wordpress then it is strongly encouraged that you have your portfolio built in Wordpress. [More info on wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)

# Reminders:
You can always re-create or update your portfolio, don't spend all project week perfecting it. Don't spend all project week learning Wordpress. Just get it done! 

We highly recommend saving a day or two at the end of the project week to complete your portfolio **OR** working on it a little bit regularly throughout the project week.
