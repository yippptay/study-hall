# Introduction to Data Structures / Linked Lists

## Overview

This lesson covers an introduction to the concept of Data Structures, as well as an overview of one data structure: Linked Lists.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

**_Data Structures_**

-   Explain how data structures are used in computer science.
-   Define the five basic operations to perform on a data structure.
-   Build an array and perform basic functions in it.

**_Linked Lists_**

-   Define a linked list.
-   Explain how a node stores data.
-   Determine whether to use a linked list or an array for a given scenario.
-   Build a singly linked list.

## Prerequisites

-   Introduction to Computer Science
-   Algorithms

## Activity

Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science. A data structure is a container that stores data in a specific, organized way so that it can be accessed, used and analyzed. There are five basic operations that can be performed on data structures: 

1. **Access**: Retrieving a specific data point
2. **Insert**: Adding a data point
3. **Delete**: Removing a data point
4. **Search**: Determining whether a specific value is in the data set
5. **Sort**: Ordering data points by one or more characteristics

To learn more about data structures as well as one type (linked lists), there are three components to this lesson, which should be done in the following order:

1. myGA module: [Introduction to Data Structures](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/878)
2. myGA module: [Linked Lists](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/397)
3. Exercise: [Implementing a Linked List](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWQVm)

## Additional Resources

-   This [video](https://youtu.be/9YddVVsdG5A) from freeCodeCamp provides a great overview, visuals, as well as code sample for Linked Lists. The set up and variable names are slightly different from what is in your in-class exercise, but the principles are the same. It's also part of a larger series on Data Structures, which is highly recommended!
- This [article](https://codeburst.io/linked-lists-in-javascript-es6-code-part-1-6dd349c3dcc3) from codeburst.io is another great overview of Linked Lists with code examples.
