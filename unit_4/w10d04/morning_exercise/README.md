# Study Hall

For the remaining morning exercises in this course, they will be more like "study halls". Meaning, this is the time for you to practice what you want to. We will give our suggestions, but ultimately it is up to you how you utilize this time.

# Divide and Conquer Sorts

## Overview
This lesson covers two sorting algorithms that use the "divide-and-conquer" method: merge sort and quick sort.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe how to use merge sort and quick sort to sort data.
- Explain the space and time complexities of merge sort and quick sort.
- Identify when to use merge sort or quick sort in a given scenario.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Recursion
* Intro to Sorting


## Activity

There are a few components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/882)
2. [Activity: Implementing the Sorts](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWpQW)


## Additional Resources
* Check out [this visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) for both merge sort and quick sort.
* Revisit our folk-dancing friends, now showing [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaqR3G_NVoo) and [quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8&list=PLuE79vNc5Wi6q34LsQcaJ7ISQ8uOyMaL_&index=4).
* [This tool](http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/) is useful for understanding how quick sort works.
* Watch how these algorithms look sketched out for [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzeBrDU-JaY) and [quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COk73cpQbFQ&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwKedT2KfDMB9YA5DgASZb3U&index=8&t=0s).

## Hungry for More?

Do some coding challenges on codewars, or practice your CSS by trying to recreate your favorite site's styling, practice python by trying to convert old JS code to python, etc.!
