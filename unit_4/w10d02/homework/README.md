# Python Practice + CS Modules

## Part 1: Phrase Repeater
Write a Python program that repeats a phrase given by the user, the number of times the user requests it to be repeated.

When it works, your terminal should look something like this:

## Part 2: FizzBuzz in Python
Translate FizzBuzz into Python:

1. Write a Python program that prints all numbers from 1 - 100.
1. If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number.
1. If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number.
1. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Feel free to revisit your JavaScript solution for reference.


## Part 3: Ethereum Converter
Translate your Bitcoin converter to an Ethereum converter. Feel free to reference your code from earlier today, and to revisit [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) for the current price of Ethereum.
