# Frequency Counter

# Goal: Count frequency of words and create dictionary listing each word and frequency

#Slice it
#1. Loop over each word in list
#2. Take word and count instances in list
#3. Add to dictionary with number of freqency

#Dice It
#1A Use for loop to iterate over word list
#2A Each loop do another for loop over word list
#2B Each loop test whether words are equal
#3C Add to a dictionary word as key with count as value
