## Getting Started

1. In today's morning exercise folder, you'll find a starter_code directory with an `index.html`, `main.css`, and an `images` folder.
1. `cd` into that directory, open your `index.html` in the browser and examine the code and images you've been given.
1. Your goal is to style the HTML that has been provided to look like the mockup below.

## Activity

A few notes to keep in mind:
1. Be sure to examine the code you've been given carefully. When working with other people's code, you'll find it much easier if you have an idea as to what's already going on before you start making changes. If it helps to create a wireframe based on how the code is written, go for it!
1. Don't worry about matching the fonts the site uses. Just use `font-family: Arial` or `font-family: Times New Roman` or whatever you like.
1. Don't worry about rounded corners of buttons. If you can figure it out, great! If not, no worries!
1. It's fine to guess at the colors
1. **The main thing we want you to focus on is the positioning/layout!**
