During the last morning exercise, we built out the HTML for the VSSL mockup:

![vssl](vssl_mockup/mockup.png)

This morning, we're going to work on styling it with CSS to make it look more like the mockup.

## Setup

1. You already created the HTML for this mockup last morning exercise. You should have it in your `w02d01/morning_exercise/vssl_mockup` folder. We called it `index.html`. Just continue working in that folder
1. Inside that vssl_mockup folder, create a `style.css` file. Make sure it's on the same level as your `index.html` file as well as the `img` folder and `mockup.png` file.
1. Inside your `index.html` file, link your `style.css`
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - You can check that your CSS is attached correctly by adding a background color to the page temporarily.  

## Activity

1. Your focus should be on positioning the content!
1. Save looking for fonts for last. You don't need the exact font - just choose something that looks similar.

## Resources

If you struggled making the html, we've included an sample_index.html for you to work off of in the vssl_mockup folder.

## Hungry for More?

Finished the VSSL mockup? Try another! We've provided a second mockup in the [doggie directory](doggie).

- [View the mockup here](doggie/readme.md)
- `cd` into the `doggie` directory and do your html layout mockup in the provided `index.html` file!
   - If you get to the css, make sure to use the provided `main.css` file as well
- :elephant: Reminder: We provided all the images needed in the `img` folder, so you'll need to use _relative pathing_ to get those into your index.html
