# Part 1
[Random Imager](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Nova/blob/master/unit_1/w03d02/student_labs/random_imager.md)

# Part 2 HTML + CSS Practice
1. Spend 5 - 10 minutes finding a calculator you find aesthetically pleasing or interesting (it can be in google images, in your house, on your phone). Draw a wireframe and take some notes.
1. Create your calculator with HTML and CSS!

### Getting started with the HTML
1. Before you type out your HTML, draw out how you want your calculator to look and start thinking about how to structure your html. Don't spend more than 10 minutes thinking through this part, but put something on paper before you code. This is your chance to create a [wireframe](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/jargon-wireframes-mockups-prototypes-51514898)!

### Getting started with the CSS
1. If you want to keep things simple, start by putting a border around all of your divs - this will help you visualize where each of your div elements are and how much space they're taking up.

```
div {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```
2.  Set a height and width on your elements.

### Finishing up the HTML
1. Tomorrow we'll be using jQuery to make our calculators function. To prepare for this, think about adding additional ids and/or classes to help you select your elements.

# Part 3
[Grids and Pyramids](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Nova/blob/master/unit_1/w03d02/student_labs/grids_and_pyramids.md)

## Deliverables
 - Your HW submission issue should contain a link to your `student_labs` folder (which should have your `Random Imager` and `Grids and Pyramids` work, as well as a link to your `homework` folder, which contain your `Calculator` work.
